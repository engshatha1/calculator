# calculator
Create a calculator project using :HTML and JavaScript ,CSS. 

• To create the calculator, I first wrote the title of the page and then in the body a table with four rows and four columns was created and the numbers were written inside the form and a special form was made to enter the data.

• Also in the header the css file was called and javascript was written inside the header.

• Inside the script I created three functions:

1. insertrNum: To make the user enter numbers and operations using the button and they appear on the screen.
2. FinalValue: To show the result of the numbers and heights entered on the screen and I also used a function inside the main function (expression) to do the operation.
3. ClearScreen: To erase what appeared on the screen.
